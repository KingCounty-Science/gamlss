# gamlss

Currently testing application of gamlss to river annual peak and low flow modeling and forecasting.Not a functional project for sharing yet, but I will try and make it more reproducible over time. Added necessary basin shape files produced with streamstats_app.R but PRISM data files too large to push to github. One will need to use prism_get.R and process data using appropriate basin shapefiles to calculate seasonal mean precipitation and air temperature to use as model variables.
